# FriendshipCountdown

Just getting started. 

This is an app that will allow you to input list of friends and then have a countdown reminder of who you haven't contacted more than a desired period (you can set default or custom time per person). 


## Tech Stack

Roughly defined tech stack:

###  Backend

- Node.js

- Fastify

- NestJS

###  Frontend

- React

- Next.js


Later OpenAI will somehow be integrated and other infratructure (Kafka, k8s etc) will follow.
